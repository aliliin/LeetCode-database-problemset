SELECT d.Name AS Department, e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary AS Salary
FROM Employee e
    LEFT JOIN Department d ON d.id = e.DepartmentId
WHERE e.Salary = (
    SELECT MAX(Salary)
    FROM Employee
    WHERE DepartmentId = d.Id
);

SELECT d.Name AS Department, e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary AS Salary
FROM Employee e
    INNER JOIN Department d
WHERE d.id = e.DepartmentId
    AND e.Salary = (
        SELECT MAX(Salary)
        FROM Employee
        WHERE DepartmentId = d.Id
    );
